Using Percentages & Avoiding Heights

    Percentages vs Fixed Heights/ Widths
        All the Block level elements by default responsive. How?
            Default width => 100% [100% of Parent Element]


    Percentages on the Child:
        .parent {

        }
        .child {
            width: 50%;
        }

        Width is going to be 50% of the Parent. Not the entire page.


    Why it's a good idea to avoid heights ?
        By default browser is responsive. Only when we made few changes
    the browser will run into IRRESPONSIVE.
